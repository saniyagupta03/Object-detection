# Object-detection
This project focuses on detecting safety equipment (like helmets, vests, and other PPE) using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. 

# Important instructions
- raw_data must contain the dataset in the form of YOLO i.e. two folders named images and labels respectively. Export from label-studio in YOLO format and extract the zip file in the same directory. 
- run the first script to change the file format of images.
